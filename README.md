Interpretation:

- In this bar chart, we explore the effect of family and friends on the choice, aiming to shed light on influence on the choice.
- Each bar represents a distinct category, and the height of the bars corresponds to the count of the car purchase interest, providing a visual representation of the distribution and patterns within the data.
- The chart reveals that “Somewhat likely” and “Very likely” are the highest categories
As it illustrates that the choice of purchasing a electric car is influenced by family, friends and colleagues.


2.	Is there a relationship between the influencers and the infrastructure?
   
- When reading this table, we are interested in the results of the Pearson Chi-Square row. We can see here that the value = 1.854, p = .933. This tells us that there is no statistically significant association between Influencers and Infrastructure.

 
- Phi value = .213 and Cramer's V value = .150. We can see that the strength of association between the variables is very weak.
- We can see that there is no relationship between the influence of social connections and Infrastructure for the use of electric cars
3.	What is the role of the infrastructure for the consumers? 
 
 

- The majority of customers (61.0%) consider infrastructure for electric vehicle power stations crucial, with an additional 31.7% emphasizing its very crucial importance. Only a small percentage (7.3%) expressed a neutral stance, indicating a clear consensus on the critical role of robust infrastructure in supporting electric vehicles.

-Interpretation:
- Collaboration between government entities, private organizations, and stakeholders in the automotive industry. Collaborative efforts can lead to more comprehensive infrastructure development.
- Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to ensure that the infrastructure meets evolving needs and technological advancements in the electric vehicle sector.
- Making a mobile application to detect the location of the power stations to make it easy for the customers.

4.	What affects adaptation? (cost, technical barriers,  ..) 
 

 

- The table and the bar chart present the challenges associated with the adoption of electric cars, as reported by customers. The most prominent challenge reported was the scarcity of charging stations, with 46.3% of customers highlighting this as a significant barrier which came after it initial cost to purchase, recharging takes time, I don’t know enough about electric cars and limited choice is the smallest percentage of customer presented.

- Recommendation:
- Based on the interpretations, 
1- focusing on expanding the charging infrastructure to alleviate concerns about recharging time and the limited availability of charging stations.
2- Working with the financial department to develop attractive financing options, including low-interest loans.
3- the possibility of the Collaboration with electric car manufacturers to explore the possibility of offering discounts, promotions, or special pricing for electric models.



5.	Which brand is preferred? Descriptive

 
- There are 64 valid brand names and 22 missing values in the dataset.

 
- Tesla leads the electric car market, with BMW and Hyundai following it which they are the top 3 preferred electric cars between customers.

Recommendation:
- Conduct workshops and seminars to educate potential consumers about the technology, performance, and advantages of electric vehicles. Collaborate with Tesla, BMW and Hyundai to organize events.
- Work to create tailored financing plans for Tesla, BMW and Hyundai electric vehicles.
6.	Which type of car is preferred? Descriptive

 
 

- The frequency between the four-car type is similar. The majority of customers (28.8%) prefer SUVs, followed by sedans (27.1%), hatchbacks (25.4%), and sports cars. This indicates a diverse range among the surveyed individuals. The
Recommendation:
- It is advisable for Cars manufacturers and dealerships to consider offering a balanced inventory that satisfies to various car types. While SUVs may be in high demand, acknowledging the significant interest in sedans, hatchbacks, and sports cars is crucial for ensuring market demand.

7.	Is there a relationship between the brands and types of cars? 
 
- When reading this table, we are interested in the results of the "Pearson Chi-Square" row. We can see here that p = .749. This tells us that there is no statistically significant association between Brand name and Types of cars.


8.	What are the main indicators affecting the price variance percentage expected from a normal car price?
 
-After performing Stepwise method, the test excludes the Ease of purchase. 
 
- As we compare the adjusted R-square values, we see a consistent improvement as more predictors are added to the model. Therefore, Model 4 with Infrastructure, After Sales Service, Effect on Environment, and Brand name as predictors appears to be the best model among the ones presented. It has the highest adjusted R-square = (0.952), indicating that it explains 95.2% of the variation in Price Variance Percentage is explained by the variation in Infrastructure, After sales service, Effect on environment and Brand name.
 

-The 4 Models are Statistically significant which the p value all of them are below (0.05)

 

- In Model4, all predictor variables are significant. Infrastructure has the strongest positive impact, followed by After Sales Service and Effect on Environment. Brand name has a significant negative impact on the dependent variable. These findings provide valuable insights into the relationships between the predictors and the dependent variable.


9.	Does price variance percentage differ according to the education level? 

 

- The p-value (0.482) indicates that the differences between the groups are not statistically significant, there is no strong evidence to suggest that the mean "Price Variance Percentage" differs significantly across education level.


10.	Does price variance percentage differ if the car was secondary car for this household?

 

- The p-value for Levene’s test for equality of variances is 0.566 which is greater than 0.05, so we do not reject the null hypothesis that the variances of the two groups are equal. 
The p-value for the two-tailed test is 0.148, but since we have chosen a one-sided alternative hypothesis, we should use a one-tailed test. Thus, we should divide the p value computed by SPSS by two, which gives p = 0.075 > 0.05 We cannot reject the null hypothesis, then we can conclude that there is no difference in price variance percentage based on the category of use.
